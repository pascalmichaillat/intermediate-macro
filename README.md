# Intermediate Macroeconomics

This repository contains all the material for a one-semester course in intermediate macroeconomics. No textbook is required for the course. Nevertheless,  *Macroeconomics* by Olivier Blanchard (7th edition, Pearson) nicely complements several parts of the course.

The course material was developed by [Pascal Michaillat](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/) for ECON 1210 at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu).
