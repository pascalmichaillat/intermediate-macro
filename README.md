# Intermediate Macroeconomics

This repository contains material for a one-semester course in intermediate macroeconomics.

## Overview

The course explores core topics in macroeconomics, including national statistics, consumption and saving, unemployment, inflation, business cycles, monetary and fiscal policy, economic growth, and population dynamics. The course starts by presenting short-run and long-run economic fluctuations in the United States and abroad. It then introduces models describing such fluctuations: 

+ IS-LM model of business cycles
+ Matching model of unemployment
+ Models of inflation
+ Malthusian model of preindustrial growth
+ Solowian model of modern growth

## Material

The material for the course is contained in four folders:

+ `lectures` folder: 30 slide decks for 30 one-hour lectures
+ `references` folder: 3 journal articles describing the basic matching model and basic Malthusian model presented in the lectures
+ `homework` folder: 
	* 8 problem sets, with their solutions
	* 100 multiple-choice questions, with their solutions
+ `exams` folder: 
	* 2 midterm exams, each with a practice version and solutions
	* 1 final exam, with a practice version and solutions

## Useful resource

No textbook is required for this course, but [Macroeconomics](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Blanchard-Macroeconomics-7th-Edition/PGM333935.html) by Olivier Blanchard nicely complements several parts of the course.
